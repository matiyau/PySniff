	abstract = {The IEEE 802.11 standard defines Wi-Fi probe requests as a active mechanism with which mobile devices can request information from access points and accelerate the Wi-Fi connection process. Researchers in previous work have identified privacy hazards associated with Wi-Fi probe requests, such as leaking past access points identifiers and user mobility. Besides several efforts to develop privacy-preserving alternatives, modern mobile devices continue to use Wi-Fi probe requests. In this work, we quantify Wi-Fi probe requests' threat to privacy by conducting an experimental study of the most popular smartphones in different settings. Our objective is to identify how different factors influence the probing frequency and the average number of broadcasted probes. Our conclusions are worrisome: On average, some mobile devices send probe requests as often as 55 times per hour, thus revealing their unique MAC address at high frequency. Even if a mobile device is not charging and in sleep mode, it might broadcast about 2000 probes per hour. We also evaluate a commercially deployed MAC address randomization mechanism, and demonstrate a simple method to re-identify anonymized probes.},

	title = {{WiFiPi}: {Involuntary} tracking of visitors at mass events},
	shorttitle = {{WiFiPi}},
	doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583443},
	abstract = {To simulate crowds at mass events, realistic movement data of people is required. Despite their limited capacity for approximating real human mobility, synthetic movement models are traditionally used for this purpose. More realistic simulations can be achieved by using real-life movement data, gathered by observing people in the desired context. This paper presents a method for tracking people at mass events without the need for active cooperation by the subjects. The mechanism works by scanning at multiple locations for packets sent out by the Wi-Fi interface on visitors' smartphones, and correlating the data captured at these different locations. The proposed method can be implemented at very low cost on Raspberry Pi computers. This implementation was trialed in two different contexts: a popular music festival and a university campus. The method allows for tracking thousands of people simultaneously, and achieves a higher coverage rate than similar methods for involuntary crowd tracking. Moreover, the coverage rate is expected to increase even further as more people will start using smartphones. The proposed method has many applications in different domains. It also entails privacy implications that must be considered when deploying a similar system.},
