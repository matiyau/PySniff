% Introduce the problem you are trying to gather data and learn about.

Crowd activity monitoring, which is useful in several applications, is a challenging task. In this paper, we attempt to estimate the number of people present at a site, by counting the number of WiFi-enabled devices in the vicinity. The use of handheld devices for accessing internet-based services has increased significantly in the recent years. With features like smart network switch, smartphone users no longer need to manually switch from WiFi to Cellular data when they go outdoors. Thus, most of users leave the WiFi radio enabled, even when not connected to any access point. We exploit the fact that WiFi stations transmit packets whether or not they are associated with an access point. By sniffing these packets, the devices present at the site can be identified.
